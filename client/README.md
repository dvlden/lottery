# Application for Lottery (web3)

Very simple application for Lottery through MetaMask.

### Prerequisite

If you deployed the Contract yourself, there were two outputs from the terminal. You will need them in this application.

Open `src/artifact.ts` and replace `address` and `abi` constants.

If you did not deploy the Contract yourself and you don't want to interact with the Contract as the manager _(for some extra functionality)_... Then you do not need to change anything. The application will already work with the Contract that I deployed already.

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` – to serve the application locally for development
- `npm run build` – to build the application for deployment
